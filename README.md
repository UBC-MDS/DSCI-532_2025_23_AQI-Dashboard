## 🌍 What are we doing? (And why?)
### The Problem
Air pollution in India poses a severe health risk, affecting millions of people daily. Monitoring air quality in real-time and analyzing historical trends can empower individuals, policymakers, and researchers to take informed action.

### The Solution
The **India AQI Dashboard** aims to:

✅ **Visualize AQI trends** through interactive maps and charts.  
✅ **Provide historical insights** to track air pollution over time.  
✅ **Help users make data-driven decisions** regarding health and travel.  
✅ **Offer an open-source platform** for developers and researchers to enhance and extend.  

This dashboard makes AQI data more accessible and engaging, ensuring that everyone can stay informed about air quality conditions in India.
