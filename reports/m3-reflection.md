In this milestone we overhauled the presentation of our dashboard. Previously we had a solid color background of a dark color which made reading the dashboard difficult for some of our reviewers. Taking this into account, we switched to a lighter color theme so our dashboard is more legible. We also moved our widgets into a sidebar so its easier for a user to know where all the inputs of our dashboard are and where all the outputs are. One of joel’s comments was to add a stacked bar chart which would display the AQI bucket labels for the selected cities over the chosen time. We expected this to be useful information for our intended group but after creating the graph it seems that there isn’t much chance in the number of these labels over time. Next week we plan on drilling deeper into this to see if we can pull any valuable insights from this information or not. Another one of joel’s comments was to include the black line (average) in the legend for our line plot. This provide more difficult than we anticipated as the way we’ve done this in the backend is to create two different plot and combine them hence adding average to the legend is difficult. As a temporary measure we’re added this in the title of the graph but this is on our list for next week.

Another feature change we were able to implement was to switch out the city drop down for a map instead. This retains much of the same functionality as the cities dropdown but shows users where the cities they’re interested in are with regards to the country as a whole. Since there are cities in all 4 corners of the country, this could provide some intuition behind the results a user may see (i.e. a city’s latitude may affect its gas concentrations.

Some feedback we received indicated that our results were difficult to understand. Even though our dashboard is intended for researchers who will know this subject well and will be able to understand the basics of our dashboard with ease, we’re thinking of adding a description of all charts or complicated terms so that the average public can also take advantage of our graph. We’re still deciding on the best way to do as we don’t want it to be too intrusive and take away from our current dashboard but also informative enough that its helpful for people who aren’t experts in the subject matter. 

Challenging: we really liked how this group set up their page as it was easy to follow and understand how their inputs and outputs were connected. We decided to follow a similar approach by separating our inputs from our outputs using color and used a similar technique for our title. https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2025_16_LongevityVisualizer
