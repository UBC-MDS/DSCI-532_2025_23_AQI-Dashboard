# Motivation and purpose

# Description of the data

The dataset we're using contains air quality information for 5 cities in India over the span of 10 years. The data itself is taken hourly (~432,000 lines) but we're planning on converting it to daily values to cut down on the processing we have to do (24x smaller). In addition to AQI the dataset also includes measurements for various greenhouse gases over the same time frame. 

Using this data we plan to create a informative and easy to understand dashboard that will show the fluctuations in the air quality of the 5 cities over time. By doing this, we hope the general public becomes interested in their local air quality. We also plan on deriving the cumulative change over the user's specified time period in the various gases and AQI allowing users to see if thereâ€™s been an overall increase of decrease.
