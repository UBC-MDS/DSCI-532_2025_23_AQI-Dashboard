# Motivation and purpose

# Description of the data

The dataset we're using contains air quality information for 5 cities in India over the span of 10 years. The data itself is taken hourly (~432,000 lines) but we're planning on converting it to daily values to cut down on the processing we have to do (24x smaller). In addition to AQI the dataset also includes measurements for various greenhouse gases over the same time frame. 

Using this data we plan to create a informative and easy to understand dashboard that will show the fluctuations in the air quality of the 5 cities over time. By doing this, we hope the general public becomes interested in their local air quality. We also plan on deriving the cumulative change over the user's specified time period in the various gases and AQI allowing users to see if there’s been an overall increase of decrease.

# Research questions and usage scenarios

This dashboard aims to help the Indian general public understand long-term air quality trends in their cities. It answers key questions such as how air quality has changed over the past decade, which months have the worst pollution levels, and which pollutants contribute the most to poor air quality. Users can also compare pollution trends across cities and identify seasonal patterns.

Raj is a working professional and father of two in Delhi. He has heard some news about smog in his city and is concerned about the impact of air pollution on his family’s health. Using the dashboard, he filters for Delhi and explores AQI trends over the past 10 years. He compares the trend to other cities and examines how pollution levels vary by season. He filters through the different pollutant data on the dashboard and identifies PM2.5 as a major contributor, and notices that winter months consistently have the worst air quality. After analyzing the data, he decides to limit outdoor activities for his children during peak pollution months. He also shares his findings with a local advocacy group pushing for cleaner public transportation and stricter air quality regulations.
