After discussing with Professor Joel, our final dashboard evolved significantly from our initial sketch, as most of the proposed output visualizations were not directly implemented except for the correlation of pollutants with AQI and one of the data cards. The originally planned pollutant concentration over time plot and the pollutant measure comparison across cities were combined into one, primarily because the content was similar. Additionally, the data card highlighting the most correlated pollutant was changed to display the most frequent AQI bucket. The original idea was redundant with the correlation bar chart and would not add any meaningful insights, while the most frequent AQI bucket could help researchers quickly get a sense of air quality with the applied filters. One of the most significant additions was an interactive map, which serves as a valuable tool for researchers who may not be familiar with the geography of India.

Our final dashboard also deviates from the original sketch in several ways to improve usability and effectiveness. Instead of using two dropdowns for selecting start and end dates, we implemented a date range picker, which provides a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. We also changed the theme from a multi-coloured gradient background to a solid colour. This removes distractions and will help make the dashboard more cohesive.

We believe our dashboard is easy to understand, responds quickly to any user interaction, and makes the most of the data we are using. The user inputs are easy to use and filter all of the outputs in a consistent way. We have a total of eight components, satisfying the conditions of the challenging question in this milestone. Each component is unique and provides valuable insights to environmental researchers.

While the dashboard effectively presents air quality data with interactive elements, there are still areas for improvement. Enhancing the formatting, particularly by making the color scheme more cohesive and fixing the spacing, would improve readability and visual appeal. Additionally, incorporating the average AQI into the line chart legend would provide better context for trend analysis. Introducing additional interactivity, for example filtering by city based on users clicking on the map, would take our dashboard to the next level. Finally, there are some minor calculation and display errors we will need to fix: the PM2.5 line is not showing up in the line chart, the Indian average line should not change based on which cities are selected, the percentage change data card is not calculating consistently with the line chart, and the correlation values are too low in the bar chart. Given the time constraints, we were not able to implement these features and correct the issues at this point. These refinements would help make the dashboard more polished, visually coherent, and user-friendly.
